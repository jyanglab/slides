# Plant Domestication

<div align="center">
<img src="Teosinte.png" height=200>
</div>

- “Plant domestication is the _genetic modification_ of a wild species to create a new form of a plant altered _to meet human needs_.” 
> Doebley et al., 2006

--

__Plant domestication__ is the process whereby wild plants have been evolved into crop plants through artificial selection. 

- This usually involves an early hybridization event followed by selective breeding.

# Wild and domesticated species

# Sequencing platforms

### Illumina (HiSeq, MiSeq, NextSeq)
- Throughput: very high
- Read length: up to 2x300 bp 
- Accuracy: high (error rate is < 1%)

# DNA Sequencing

#### Short read sequencing can often be produced as either single-end or paired-end.

- #### Paired-end (SE) 

  - Means that two reads of equal length come from the same larger piece of DNA
  
  - The length is approximately known

- #### Single-end (SE) 
  - Just have one read.

There are two __polymorphisms__ (or segregating sites)

Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( __SNPs__ )
  - In the 3rd position, we have T/C alleles
  - In the 8th position, we have G/T alleles
]


The set of alleles found on a single sequence is referred to as a __haplotype__.
- _TG_ haplotype and _CT_ haplotype

__Allele frequency__:

- In the 3rd position, __Major allele__ is T and __Minor allele__ is C

# Allele and genotype frequencies

]

Consider a diploid locus segregating for two alleles ( $A_1$ and $A_2$ ).
We usually define the less frequent allele (or minor allele) as the $A_1$ allele.

### Allele frequency ( $p$ and $q$ ) 
Frequency/proportion of alleles of a particular identity at one locus

### Genotype frequency ( $f_{11}$, $f_{12}$, $f_{22}$ )
Proportion of individuals with a specific genotype (combination of alleles)

- dog 2: AA AA __CC__ CC GG
- dog 3: AA AA __CT__ CC GG 
- dog 4: AA AA __CT__ CC GG
- dog 5: AA AA __CC__ CC GG
]

Let $n$ be the total number of individuals in the population. Genotype frequency of __TT__ is:

```{r}
n = 5
n11 = 1
f11 = n11/n
f11
```

--

The frequency of minor allele $A_1$ in the population is then given by

\begin{align*}
p = \frac{2n_{11}+n_{12}}{2n} = f_{11} + \frac{1}{2}f_{12}
\end{align*}


---

# Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

#### A population is in HWE if it has constant allele and genotype frequencies __from generation to generation__

- Allele frequencies in parents predict allele and genotype frequencies in offspring

--

### Caveats

- A large, randomly-mating population for diploid species

- No selection, no mutation, no migration, etc.
  
---

# In Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

If allele frequencies in parent population = $p$ & $q$, 
then, genotype frequencies in progeny after random mating are:

\begin{align*}
(p + q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2
\end{align*}

- The array of genotypes in progeny equals the square of the parental gametic array. 

- (sum of allele frequencies) $^2$ = (sum of genotype frequencies)

##### Refers to a history of a locus in which advantageous mutations have arisen and fixed or are in the process of fixing.

--

- Advantageous mutations __much rarer__ than deleterious mutations.

- Advantageous mutation can rapidly increase in frequency.
- Patterns generated by this rapid rise are used to detect signatures of positive selection.

#### Refers to a history of a locus in which the vast majority of mutations that have arisen and been removed due to their deleterious effects.

--

- A gene or noncoding region under negative selection is often conserved.

- These genes or regions are constrained by selection.

- Relatively common

---
# Balancing selection


- Alleles under balancing selection are not universally advantageous or deleterious.

--

- Balanced polymorphisms consist of alleles whose fitness changes with time, space, or population frequency. 

  - __Heterozygote advantage (or overdominant) selection__: heterozygotes genotypes have higher fitness than either homozygous genotype
  
  - __Spatially or temporally varying selection__: Fitness of alleles in a population is dependent on the environment or season

# Basic principles of evolutionary processes

Factors lead  to changes of allele frequency

### Systematic processes

Predictable both in amount and in direction

- _Migration_
  - not a major concern in plant breeding

- _Mutation_
  - Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation
  - Mutation alone produces slow change in allele frequency

--

- __Selection__
  - An important forces in shaping the allele frequency changes

---

# Basic principles of evolutionary processes

Factors lead  to changes of allele frequency


### Stochastic process

Arises in small populations from the effect of sampling.

- __Genetic drift__

  - Predictable in amount but not in direction


---

# Selection (on Fitness)


- Selection coefficient ( $s$ ) 
  - The proportionate __REDUCTION__ in gametic contribution of a particular genotype _compared to the standard genotype_

- Relative fitness: $w = 1 -s$
  - Most fit is set to 1

--

---------
#### For example

-  $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ have survival of 0.75, 0.75, and 0.5, respectively

--

- Then, the relative fitness is 1.0, 1.0, and 0.67 (0.5/0.75)

--

---

# Selection with dominance

- Dominance needs to be accounted for when quantifying allele frequency changes with selection.

- The degree of dominance influences the relative fitness of alleles. 

- Here dominance is with respect to fitness only.


<div align="center">
<img src="dominance.png" width=350>
</div>

---

# Selection with dominance

Here, $h$ is the __level of dominance__

- It is the heterozygous effect from the fitness of the heterozygote relative to the difference between homozygotes.

--

In the example, __ $A_1$ is the most favorable allele__, conferring the greatest degree of fitness

| Degree of dominance | $A_1A_1$   | $A_1A_2$   | $A_2A_2$   |
| :-------: | : ------ : | :-------: | :-------: |
| Additive           | $1$    | $1 - s/2$    | $1 - s$     | 
| Partial dominance   |  $1$        |  $1 - hs$        |  $1 -s$   | 
| Complete dominance | $1$   | $1$    | $1 - s$    |
| Overdominance      | $1 -s_1$ | $1$ | $1-s_2$ |

# Selection against the recessive allele

- Gametic contribution is the product of genotype freq and fitness

| Initial frq           | $p^2$    | $2pq$    | $q^2$     |

| Fitness ( $w$ )   |  $1$        |  $1$        |  $1-s$   | 
| Gametic contribution | $p^2$   | $2pq$    | $q^2(1-s)$    |

| Gametic contribution | $p^2$   | $2pq$    | $q^2(1-s)$    |  $1-sq^2$ |



--

### After one generation of selection against recessive

Note that there has been a proportionate loss of $sq^2$ due to the selection.

The $A_1$ allele freq, 


\begin{align*}
p_1 & = \frac{(2p^2 + 2pq)/2}{p^2 + 2pq + q^2(1-s)} = \frac{p(p+q)}{1 -sq^2}\\
& = \frac{p}{1- sq^2} \\
\end{align*}

---

# Selection

### After one generation of selection against recessive


\begin{align*}
p_1  = \frac{p}{1- sq^2} \\
\end{align*}

### Change in allele freq after one generation

\begin{align*}
\Delta p & = p_1 - p_0  = \frac{p}{1- sq^2} - p\\
& = \frac{p-p(1-sq^2)}{1-sq^2} \\
& = \frac{spq^2}{1 - sq^2}
\end{align*}

--

Then,

\begin{align*}
\Delta q & = -\Delta p = -\frac{spq^2}{1 - sq^2}
\end{align*}

# Simulation for selection against recessive

# Effectiveness of Selection

### Initial allele freq

  - Most effective at intermediate freq
  
  - Inefficient when targeted recessive allele is rare

--

### Degree of dominance

- It will become more complex

# Small Populations

### Genetic drift

Change in allele frequencies __by chance__ from the random sampling of gametes in a finite (small) population

--

Allele frequencies are subject to __random fluctuations__ arsing from the sampling of gametes.



---

# Consequences of small population

### Random drift

- Leads to allele fixation

--

### Differentiation between sub-populations

- Leads to genetic differentiation and local group (or geographic isolation)

--

### Uniformity within sub-populations

- Reduces diversity and becomes more alike in genotype in local groups

--

### Increased homozygosity

- Reduces heterozygotes and results in inbreeding
