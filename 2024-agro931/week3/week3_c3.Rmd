# Systematic and dispersive processes

### Systematic process: mutation, migration, and selection

- Bring the allele frequencies to stable equilibria at particular value


--

### Dispersive process - drift

- Scatter the allele frequencies away from these equilibrium

- Eventually lead to all alleles being either fixed or lost


---

# Non-recurrent neutral mutation

### Infinite allele model (IAM) of mutation

  - Probability of the same mutation occurs more than once is very, very, very small
  
--

### Neutral model (new allele has no effect on fitness)

  - Probability new allele becomes fixed in the absence of selection = $\frac{1}{2N}$
  
  - If $\mu$ is mutation rate at the locus, total number of new mutants = $2N\mu$
  
  - Probability of a new mutant being fixed $= 2N \mu \times \frac{1}{2N} = \mu$

# Effective neutral mutation

#### Probability of fixation of new mutation is influenced by selection 

- Favorable (beneficial) or unfavorable (deleterious)

Pr(fixation) \approx \frac{1}{2N_e}

- __Effective neutral mutation__ is one  a coefficient of selection $s$ against it
  - Range from $s=0$ (neutral) to $s=\frac{1}{2N_e}$ or 

--

  - $N_es < 1/2$: effectively neutral
  
  - $N_es > 1/2$: under selection

---

# Effective neutral mutation

### $N_es < 1/2$: effectively neutral

For example, inbred lines of mice resulting from sib matings have $N_e \approx 2.5$

- To keep $N_es < 1/2$, $s$ can be as high as 0.2 and this allele could become fixed due to drift and have a negative effect on fitness

--

- The indication: favorable mutants are far too rare to counter balance the loss of fitness in small population!
