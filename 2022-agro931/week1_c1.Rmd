# Scope of the Course

### Population genetics

Study the genetic composition of natural populations and its evolutionary causes and consequences.

- `Popgen` is the study of **evolution**.

- The language of `popgen` is **Mathematics**.

--

### Quantitative genetics 

Study of the genetic basis of phenotypic variation.

- `Quantgen` is the study of the **complex trait**, or **phenotype**.

- The language of `Quantgen` is **Statistics**.

--

- [AGRO-932](https://jyanglab.com/agro932/) (Biometrical genetics and plant breeding) 
  - Spring of every even-numbered year (next offfer: Spring 2024)

Population genetics emerged from early efforts to reconcile Mendelian genetics with Darwinian thought.

- Many of the important ideas and mathematical models emerged before the 1940s
- Before DNA was discovered and yet the usefulness of these models has not diminished

In the 2nd part of the course, we will be deeply involved with the statistical evaluation of the basic quantitative genetic models.

# Definitions

#### Locus (plural: loci)
A __locus__ is a specific spot in the genome: maybe an entire gene, or a single base pair. 
- such as, chr1 from 1001-1005: A A __T__ C G. 

--

#### Alleles
At each genetic locus, there may be multiple genetic variants segregating in the population
--- these are known as __alleles__.

- allele 1: A A __T__ C G. 
- allele 2: A A __C__ C G. 

Allele transfers from one generation to next

--

#### Genotype
- A __Genotype__ is a pair of alleles
Genotype is not transferred from one generation to the next due to segregation of alleles.


---

# Population

A population is a group of interbreeding individuals
- Same species
- Close proximity
- Share a gene pool

assuming 2 alleles per locus
]

- Each offspring = random sample of one egg and one sperm from the gene pool
- The probability of sampling a particular allele = the frequency of that allele in the gene pool, assuming equal fitness, random mating, ...

# Allele and genotype frequencies

]

Consider a diploid locus segregating for two alleles ( $A_1$ and $A_2$ ).
We usually define the less frequent allele (or minor allele) as the $A_1$ allele.

### Allele frequency ( $p$ and $q$ ) 
Frequency/proportion of alleles of a particular identity at one locus

### Genotype frequency ( $f_{11}$, $f_{12}$, $f_{22}$ )
Proportion of individuals with a specific genotype (combination of alleles)

# Allele and genotype frequencies

- dog 1: AA AA __TT__ CC GG 
- dog 2: AA AA __CC__ CC GG
- dog 3: AA AA __CT__ CC GG 
- dog 4: AA AA __CT__ CC GG
- dog 5: AA AA __CC__ CC GG
]

Let $n$ be the total number of individuals in the population. Genotype frequency of __TT__ is:

```{r}
n = 5
n11 = 1
f11 = n11/n
f11
```

The frequency of minor allele $A_1$ in the population is then given by

\begin{align*}
p = \frac{2n_{11}+n_{12}}{2n} = f_{11} + \frac{1}{2}f_{12}
\end{align*}

# Relationship between allele and genotype frequencies

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
p = seq(0, 1, by=0.01)
q = 1 - p
f11 <- p^2
f12 <- 2*p*q
f22 <- q^2

plot(f11, type="l", col="black", xlab="p", ylab="Genotype Frequency")
lines(f12, col="red")
lines(f22, col="blue")
```

# Relationship between allele and genotype frequencies

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
p = seq(0, 1, by=0.01)
q = 1 - p
f11 <- p^2
f12 <- 2*p*q
f22 <- q^2

plot(f11, type="l", col="black", xlab="p", ylab="Genotype Frequency")
lines(f12, col="red")
lines(f22, col="blue")
```

- Maximum frequency of heterozygotes occurs when p = q = 0.50

- Frequency of heterozygotes cannot be greater than 0.50

- When allele frequency is low, that allele occurs predominantly in heterozygotes
