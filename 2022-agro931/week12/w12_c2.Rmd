# Improvement of response

\begin{align*}
& R =  \frac{i h^2\sigma_P}{L} \\
\end{align*}

The form of the breeder's equation allows us to clearly see how to maximize response to selection per unit of time.


### 1. Reduce the generation interval

### 2. Increase the heritability of the trait

### 3. Increase the selection intensity

### 4. Increase additive genetic variance

# Measuring response to selection

Response selection of two  populations of broilers.
- One population was selected for __high__ 56-day body weight.
- One population was selected for __low__ 56-day body weight.

#### Causes of response variability to selection?

--

1. Genetic drift
2. Sampling error in estimating the generation mean
3. Differences in selection differential
4. Environmental factors

]


### How to separate these effects?

--

1. Maintain an unselected control population
2. Practice divergent selection
3. Or carry out replicated, parallel selection programs

# Breeder's equation

### The complex version

\begin{align*}
& R =  \frac{i h^2\sigma_P}{L} \\
\end{align*}

### The simple version

\begin{align*}
& R =  h^2 S \\
\end{align*}

--

The heritability, therefore

\begin{align*}
& h^2  = R/S \\
\end{align*}

# Realized heritability

& h_R^2 =  R/S\\

\end{align*}

Shows how the response is related to the selection differential

- The selection differential are summed across the generations plotted against the cumulative response.

- The slope of the regression line fitted to the points is equal to the average value of R/S.

# Realized heritability

\begin{align*}
& h_R^2 =  R/S\\
\end{align*}

### Be cautious:

1. Reduces response to selection after first generation for high heritability traits (__Bulmer effect__)

--

  - For complex traits, each allele carries a small effect. Therefore, allele frequencies changes are gradual and change in variance through changes in individual allele frequency is slow.
  
--

  - However, what is known as the __Bulmer effect__ immediately changes the variance of complex traits subjected to one generation of selection.

# Realized heritability

\begin{align*}
& h_R^2 =  R/S\\
\end{align*}

### Be cautious:

1. Reduces response to selection after first generation for high heritability traits (__Bulmer effect__)


2. Systematic changes in environment or inbreeding depression will affect response.
  - comparison with control line can adjust for these effects.

--

3. Random drift affect response.
  - the magnitude of random drift can be assessed by replicated selection.
