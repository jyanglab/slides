# Factors lead  to changes of allele freq

### Systematic processes

Predictable both in amount and in direction

- __Migration__

- __Mutation__

- __Selection__

--

### Stochastic process

Arises in small populations from the effect of sampling

- Predictable in amount but not in direction

---

# Migration

- Rate of change depends on rate of migration and difference in allele frequency between original pop and immigrants

- In agriculture, can think of cross-breeding as having a similar effect as migration

--

### In mixed population after migration

- $m$ = proportion of new immigrants (each generation)
- $q_m$ = allele freq in immigrant population
- $q_0$ = allele freq in original pop

--

\begin{align*}
q_1 & = mq_m + (1-m)q_0 \\
 & = m(q_m - q_0) + q_0 \\
\end{align*}

--

Change in allele freq:

\begin{align*}
\Delta q & = q_1 - q_0 = m(q_m - q_0)
\end{align*}

---

# Mutation

- To affect allele frequencies, a mutation has to be maintained!

- New mutation = heterozygote (most commonly)
  - 50% chance of being passed on 
  - After $n$ generations, the probability of the allele remains

\begin{align*}
(1 - \frac{1}{2})^n
\end{align*}

```

# Mutation

### What is the true rate of mutation ( $\mu$ )? 

- Depends on organism and locus

--

- Human:
  - Point mutation (2.5 to 1 $\times 10^{-8}$ mutations/locus/generation)
    > Neel et al 1986; Nachman and Crowell 2000

- Viruses
  - $1 \times 10^{-3}$ to $1 \times 10^{-5}$ per base/generation
  
  - SARS-CoV-2: spontaneous mutation rate of $1.3 \times 10^{-6}$ (the below study found spike protein accumulated five times more mutations)
   > Amicone et al 2022


---

# Recurrent Mutation

- Forward mutation rate __ $\mu$__ from $A_1$ $\rightarrow$ $A_2$
- Backward mutation rate __ $\nu$__ from $A_1$ $\leftarrow$ $A_2$

- Given the initial allele freq $p_0$ for $A_1$ and $q_0$ for $A_2$

--

- Change $\Delta q = \mu p_0 - \nu q_0$

--

In equilibrium,

\begin{align*}
&\Delta q = \mu p_0 - \nu q_0 = 0 \\
& \mu p_0 = \nu q_0 \\
\end{align*}

or 

\begin{align*}
& \mu (1- q) = \nu q \\
& q = \frac{\mu}{\nu + \mu} \\
\end{align*}

# Mutation

- #### Mutation alone produces slow change in allele frequency

- #### But, mutation may be important in some small pops (later)

- #### And, mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation



---

# Selection

Selection occurs due to differences in __viability__ and __fertility__ (natural or artificial)

--

The contribution of offspring to the next generation is called the __fitness__ of the individual, or _selective value_.

--

### If fitness varies by genotype, selection will occur

- __Directional__: favors phenotypes at one extreme of distribution range

- __Stabilizing__: favors intermediate phenotypes

- __Disruptive__: favors phenotypes at both extremes

---

# Selection (and Fitness)


- Selection coefficient ( $s$ ) 
  - The proportionate __REDUCTION__ in gametic contribution of a particular genotype _compared to the standard genotype_

- Relative fitness: $w = 1 -s$
  - Most fit is set to 1

--

---------
#### For example

-  $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ have survival of 0.75, 0.75, and 0.5, respectively

--

- Then, the relative fitness is 1.0, 1.0, and 0.67 (0.5/0.75)

--

---

# Selection with dominance

- Dominance needs to be accounted for when quantifying allele frequency changes with selection.

- The degree of dominance influences the relative fitness of alleles. 

- Here dominance is with respect to fitness only.

# Selection with dominance

Here, $h$ is the __level of dominance__

- It is the heterozygous effect from the fitness of the heterozygote relative to the difference between homozygotes.

--

In the example, __ $A_1$ is the most favorable allele__, conferring the greatest degree of fitness

| Degree of dominance | $A_1A_1$   | $A_1A_2$   | $A_2A_2$   |
| :-------: | : ------ : | :-------: | :-------: |
| Additive           | $1$    | $1 - s/2$    | $1 - s$     | 
| Partial dominance   |  $1$        |  $1 - hs$        |  $1 -s$   | 
| Complete dominance | $1$   | $1$    | $1 - s$    |
| Overdominance      | $1 -s_1$ | $1$ | $1-s_2$ |
