# Plant Domestication

<div align="center">
<img src="Teosinte.png" height=200>
</div>

- “Plant domestication is the _genetic modification_ of a wild species to create a new form of a plant altered _to meet human needs_.” 
> Doebley et al., 2006

--

__Plant domestication__ is the process whereby wild plants have been evolved into crop plants through artificial selection. 

- This usually involves an early hybridization event followed by selective breeding.

# Wild and domesticated species

There are two __polymorphisms__ (or segregating sites)

Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( __SNPs__ )
  - In the 3rd position, we have T/C alleles
  - In the 8th position, we have G/T alleles
]


The set of alleles found on a single sequence is referred to as a __Haplotype__.
- _TG_ haplotype and _CT_ haplotype

--

In the 3rd position, __Major allele__ is T and __Minor allele__ is C (minor allele frequency, or MAF, is 1/3)

--

If T is the same allele as the wild ancestor, then it is the __Ancestral allele__, and C is the __Derived allele__.

# Allele and genotype frequencies

- dog 4: AA AA __CT__ CC GG
- dog 5: AA AA __CC__ CC GG
]

Consider a diploid locus segregating for two alleles ( $A_1$ and $A_2$ ).
We usually define the less frequent allele (or minor allele) as the $A_1$ allele.

### Allele frequency ( $p$ and $q$ ) 
Frequency/proportion of alleles of a particular identity at one locus

### Genotype frequency ( $f_{11}$, $f_{12}$, $f_{22}$ )
Proportion of individuals with a specific genotype (combination of alleles)

---

# Allele and genotype frequencies

- dog 2: AA AA __CC__ CC GG
- dog 3: AA AA __CT__ CC GG 
- dog 4: AA AA __CT__ CC GG
- dog 5: AA AA __CC__ CC GG
]

Let $n$ be the total number of individuals in the population. Genotype frequency of __TT__ is: 1/5


--

The frequency of minor allele $A_1$ in the population is then given by

\begin{align*}
p = \frac{2n_{11}+n_{12}}{2n} = f_{11} + \frac{1}{2}f_{12}
\end{align*}

```{r}
n = 5
n11 = 1
f11 = n11/n
n12 = 2
p = f11 + 1/2*2/n
p ### allele freq of minor allele T
```


---

# Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

#### A population is in HWE if it has constant allele and genotype frequencies __from generation to generation__

- Allele frequencies in parents predict allele and genotype frequencies in offspring

--

### Caveats

- A large, randomly-mating population for diploid species

- No selection, no mutation, no migration, etc.
  
---

# In Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

If allele frequencies in parent population = $p$ & $q$, 
then, genotype frequencies in progeny after random mating are:

\begin{align*}
(p + q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2
\end{align*}

- The array of genotypes in progeny equals the square of the parental gametic array. 

- (sum of allele frequencies) $^2$ = (sum of genotype frequencies)

##### Refers to a history of a locus in which advantageous mutations have arisen and fixed or are in the process of fixing.

--

- Advantageous mutations __much rarer__ than deleterious mutations.

- Advantageous mutation can rapidly increase in frequency.
- Patterns generated by this rapid rise are used to detect signatures of positive selection.

# Case study (1): a selection sweep on Chr10

"Although man does not cause variability and cannot even prevent it, he can __select, preserve, and accumulate__ the variations given to him by the hand of nature in any way which he chooses; and thus he can certainly produce a great result."

# Case study (2): Fitness map in rice

Fitness consequence (FitCons) score ( $\rho$ ) using functional __genomic__ and __epigenomic__ datasets
> Joly-Lopez et. al., 2020, _Nature Plants_

- Chromatin accessibility
- mRNA and small RNA transcription
- DNA methylation
- 1477 rice accessions and 11 reference genomes
- Histone modifications and engaged RNA ploymerase activity

--

FitCons score ( $\rho$ ) is the probability than a mutation at that site will affect fitness.
- Values range from 0 to 1
- With 1 being the most likely to affect fitness.

--

Around __2%__ of the rice genome showed evidence of weak negative selection, 
- frequently at candidate regulatory sites, 
- including a novel set of 1,000 potentially active enhancer elements.

# Balancing selection


- Alleles under balancing selection are not universally advantageous or deleterious.

--

- Balanced polymorphisms consist of alleles whose fitness changes with time, space, or population frequency. 

  - __Heterozygote advantage (or overdominant) selection__: heterozygotes genotypes have higher fitness than either homozygous genotype
  
  - __Spatially or temporally varying selection__: Fitness of alleles in a population is dependent on the environment or season

# Basic principles of evolutionary processes

Factors lead  to changes of allele frequency

### Systematic processes

Predictable both in amount and in direction

- __Selection__
  - An important forces in shaping the allele frequency changes
  
--

- _Migration_
  - not a major concern in plant breeding

- _Mutation_
  - Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation
  - Mutation alone produces slow change in allele frequency


---

# Basic principles of evolutionary processes

Factors lead  to changes of allele frequency


### Stochastic process

Arises in small populations from the effect of sampling.

- __Genetic drift__

  - Predictable in amount but not in direction
