# Linked Selection
### Jinliang Yang

# Linked selection

SNPs themselves have no effect on fitness ( `\(s=0\)` ) but are affected by selection occurring nearby.

--

## The effect of direct selection on linked loci

- It can either __raise__ or __lower__ the linked neutral diversity

- Understand levels of neutral variation will go up or down will help to gain intuition into the modes of selection

--

  - Positive selection
  - Negative selection
  - Balancing selection


---

## Positive selection on linked neutral variation

Positive selection will lower levels of diversity in the nearby region! =&gt; __selective sweep__ 


--

### Phases of selective sweep:

.pull-left[
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="fig8.1a.png" height=100&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
]

.pull-right[
An advantageous mutation arises (shown as a start)
]

## Positive selection on linked neutral variation

Positive selection will lower levels of diversity in the nearby region! =&gt; __selective sweep__ 



### Phases of selective sweep:


.pull-left[
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="fig8.1b.png" height=110&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
]

.pull-right[
The advantageous allele rises in frequency 
]

&lt;br&gt;

- During this process all completely linked variation is swept aside, or __hitchhiking__ effect.

- The hitchhikers (the neutral polymorphisms that happen to reside on the lucky haplotype) will aslo rise in frequency.

## Positive selection on linked neutral variation

Positive selection will lower levels of diversity in the nearby region! =&gt; __selective sweep__ 

### Phases of selective sweep:


.pull-left[
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="fig8.1c.png" height=120&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
]

.pull-right[
The advantageous allele has fixed.
]


&lt;br&gt;

- After completely fixation, there would be almost no variation.

- The longer a mutation takes to fix, the more time there is for associated polymorphisms to accumulate.

---

# Factors affect the reduction in diversity

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="fig8.1.png" height=120&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

- The strength of selection ( `\(s\)` ) or fitness effect 
- The rate of recombination ( `\(c\)` )
- The time ( `\(T\)` ) since the sweep ended

--

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="fig8.2.jpg" height=200&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Seletive sweeps generate __a valley in levels of polymorphism__ surrounding the location of the advantageous allele.

---

# Factors affect the reduction in diversity

- The strength of selection ( `\(s\)` ) or fitness effect 
- The time ( `\(T\)` ) since the sweep ended

`\begin{align*}
T_{fix} \approx \frac{2 \ln{(2N_e)}}{s}
\end{align*}`

- The strength of selection, together with the population size, determines how quickly the advantageous allele fixes. (Nei 1973)
- The more quick it fixes, the lower the level of diversity and the deeper the valley.

.pull-left[
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="fig8.2.jpg" height=200&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
(Macpherson et al. 2007)
]

.pull-right[
Sweeps 1 and 2 had a similar selective advantages, but sweep2 ended longer ago than sweep1.
]

---

# Factors affect the reduction in diversity

- The strength of selection ( `\(s\)` ) or fitness effect 
- The rate of recombination ( `\(c\)` )
  - The recombination will allow nearby neutral SNPs to escape the hitchhiking effect.
  - __Negatively affect the width__ of the swept region.

--

The size of the region will be determined by (Barton 1998):
`\begin{align*}
s/c
\end{align*}`

--

.pull-left[
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="fig8.2.jpg" height=200&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
(Macpherson et al. 2007)
]

.pull-right[
&lt;br&gt;

- Sweeps 1 and 3 ended at the same time
- but sweep3 had a smaller `\(s\)`.
]

# Types of sweeps

Not all sweeps have _completely fixed_ the advantageous allele.

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="fig8.1b.png" height=110&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


### Partial sweeps

__Partial sweep__ is sampled on its way to fixation. 
- or because a change in conditions has altered the selection coefficient associated with the relevant allele.

---
# Types of sweeps

Not all sweeps are the result of _a single advantageous mutation_ arising once and fixing.

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="soft.png" height=110&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


### Hard and soft Sweeps

The scenario in which the adaptive allele has __only a single origin__ is called __hard sweep__.
- A hard sweep is when a single new mutation arises and is immediately favored by selection
- Drags along a single haplotype

---
# Types of sweeps

Not all sweeps are the result of _a single advantageous mutation_ arising once and fixing.


&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="soft.png" height=110&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


### Hard and soft Sweeps

__Soft sweep__ occur when multiple copies of the advantageous allele are fixed.
- Mutations to the same advantageous state occur on different backgrounds (multiple-origins soft sweep).
- selection acts on __standing variation__ that was previously neutral or deleterious (single-origin soft sweep)
- Less signal with a hard sweep

# Balancing selection on linked sites


&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="bs.png" height=150&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Balancing selection acting to maintain two or more alleles at intermediate frequency
in a population.

- Balancing selection acts to counter the effect of drift

- __Increase__ levels of linked neutral variation.

---

# Balancing selection on linked sites


&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="adh.png" height=300&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


- _Adh_ gene in D. melanogaster showed a signature of __long-term balancing selection__ (Kreitman and Hudson 1991)


---

# Negative selection on linked sites

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="bgs.png" height=100&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Deleterious alleles can have an effect by reducing linked neutral variation, this process called __background selection__.

- Deleterious variants are removed from the population.

- It also removes linked neutral polymorphism with them. 

### Genomic signature


__Decreased levels of genetic variation__ relative to predictions of neutral evolution (Charlesworth et al., 1993)

# Detecting selection using the SFS

## The effects of positive selection


.pull-left[
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="sfs1.png" height=300&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&gt; Hanh, 2020
]

.pull-right[
- After sweep ended, new mutations started to accumulate.

- These new mutations are by definition __singletons__
 - there is only one origin in the sample with each derived allele.
]

The SFS can be skewed toward an excess of low-frequency polymorphisms relateive to the neutral spectrum.

---
# Detecting selection using the SFS

## The effects of balancing selection

Here we consider a simple scenario with a single biallelic site that has been under balancing selection for a long time.
- Variation within each allelic class has been able to __build up__ and __reach equilibrium__

.pull-left[
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="sfs3.png" height=200&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&gt; Bitarello et al., 2018
]

.pull-right[
- Neutral mutations has accumulated both within and between allelic classes

- Overall variation is higher

- SNPs at intermediate frequency show __a distinctive "bump"__ in the SFS.
]


---
# Detecting selection using SFS

A straightforward way would be test a difference between two SFSs.
- However, linkage among sites means that __SNPs at a locus are not independent__, which violates the assumptions made by almost all such test.

--

### Instead, we use `\(\theta\)` to detect deviations.

- `\(\pi\)`: pairwise necleotide diversity.

--

- `\(\theta_W\)`: watterson's `\(\theta\)`, using total number of segregating sites

--

- `\(\epsilon_1 = S_1\)`: the number of derived singletons in a sample.
- `\(\eta_1\)`: based on all singletons in a sample.

--

Under the standard neutral model, all of these test statistics are expected to have a mean of 0.

---

# Tajima's D and related tests

Tajima (1989) constructed the first test to detect difference between the SFS. 

His statistic, `\(D\)`, was defined as:

`\begin{align*}
D = \frac{\pi - \theta_W}{\sqrt{Var(\pi - \theta_W)}}
\end{align*}`

--

Fu and Li (1993) created similar statistics. These are known as Fu and Li's `\(D\)`, `\(F\)`, `\(D^*\)`, and `\(F^*\)`.

`\begin{align*}
D = \frac{\pi - \epsilon_1}{\sqrt{Var(\pi - \epsilon_1)}}
\end{align*}`

`\begin{align*}
F = \frac{\theta_W - \epsilon_1}{\sqrt{Var(\theta_W - \epsilon_1)}}
\end{align*}`

`\begin{align*}
D^* = \frac{\pi - \eta_1}{\sqrt{Var(\pi - \eta_1)}}
\end{align*}`

`\begin{align*}
F^* = \frac{\theta_W - \eta_1}{\sqrt{Var(\theta_W - \eta_1)}}
\end{align*}`

---

# Tajima's D and related tests

Tajima (1989) constructed the first test to detect difference between the SFS. 

His statistic, `\(D\)`, was defined as:

`\begin{align*}
D = \frac{\pi - \theta_W}{\sqrt{Var(\pi - \theta_W)}}
\end{align*}`

Originally designed to fit a normal distribution, however, none of these test statistics fit a parametric distribution very well.

### Calculation

- Only variable sites at each locus are needed
- The number of invariant sites do not figure into any calculations.

---

# Interpreting values of the test statistics

Tajima's `\(D\)`, Fu and Li's `\(D, F, D^*, F^*\)`:

`\begin{align*}
D = \frac{\pi - \theta_W}{\sqrt{Var(\pi - \theta_W)}}
\end{align*}`

After a sweep, all SNPs are low in frequency, `\(\pi\)` will be much lower than expected.

While statistics based on counts of segregating sites (like `\(\theta_W\)`) will be much closer to their expected values.

--

------

- All __negative__ when there has been a sweep


---

# Interpreting values of the test statistics

Tajima's `\(D\)`, Fu and Li's `\(D, F, D^*, F^*\)`:

`\begin{align*}
D = \frac{\pi - \theta_W}{\sqrt{Var(\pi - \theta_W)}}
\end{align*}`

Balancing selection lead to an excess of intermediate frequency neutral variation surrounding a selected site.

In such case, `\(\pi\)` will be greater than `\(\theta_W\)` and other statistics.

--

------

- All __negative__ when there has been a sweep

- All __positive__ when there is balancing selection

--

- Are usually __significant__ when the values  `\(&gt; +2\)` or `\(&lt; -2\)`
  - The exact thresholds depend on sample size, number of SNPs, etc.


---
# The power of the SFS

The time window for positive selection is limited.
- Too early during the sweep 
  - signal will be not strong enough
  
--
  
- Too late after the sweep
  - Both levels and frequencies of variants will have returned to normal

--

Power also determined by the distance between our studied loci and the location of the selected site.
- Because of the effect of the recombination.
- Move far away enough and there will be no signal of selection at all.
